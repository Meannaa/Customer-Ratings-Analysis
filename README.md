# Customer-Ratings-Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of customer ratings across major fast-food chains, focusing on comparative ratings between Wendy’s and McDonald's. By exploring rating data, including mean and interquartile ranges for additional chains like Burger King and Subway, this project aims to uncover key insights into customer satisfaction and perception trends within the fast-food industry.

Using R and tools like Microsoft Excel I performed data cleaning, visualization, and statistical tests, including side-by-side boxplots, t-tests, and correlation analysis. This analysis helps identify areas where Wendy’s can enhance its service to improve ratings and overall customer satisfaction.
